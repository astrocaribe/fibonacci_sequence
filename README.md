# Calculate Fibonacci Number
----------------------------
Given that:

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) where:

f(0) = 0 and
f(1) = 1,

Write a function to represent the Fibonacci sequence. Any language will do, but feel free to use pseudocode as well.

**Note**: There are 2 ways of writing this code, what are the pros/cons of one vs. the other?
